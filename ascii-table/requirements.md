# ASCII Table Project

* output all bytes from 0 to 255
  * if it represents a printable character, print the actual character
  * if it is not a printable character, print a dash ("-") instead
  * print out the hexadecimal value of the byte
* format the output into 8 columns (one column per byte)
  * line up all the columns

## Tests
Write at least one unit test. _This implies that you have at least one function you call._

There are at least two functions you could write (based on the product definition)

# Note

Yes, this is a trivial project.

## Why are you making us write a unit test then?

Because you need to learn two things.
* How to break things up into subfunctions
* How to write simple unit tests
